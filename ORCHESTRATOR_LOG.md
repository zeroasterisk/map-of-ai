# ORCHESTRATOR LOG — Map of AI (recovery/continuity notes)

> Written by the orchestrating Hermes session (not Fable) to preserve project
> state across a context compaction. If you're Fable picking up work, or a
> future orchestrator session, START HERE alongside STATUS.md.

## Current iteration status (as of this write)

- **Live:** https://zeroasterisk.github.io/map-of-ai/
- **HEAD at write time:** `c2fb8c0` (v10 — full-height present-day coast + intensified tints, SHIPPED 2026-09-09)
- **In-flight job:** none.
- **Host note (2026-09-09):** the v10 session ran on a fresh host — no
  `/home/node/map-of-ai` clone, no `/tmp/pw*` Playwright setup, no `gh` in
  `~/.local/bin` (system `/usr/bin/gh` exists). Clone + the
  `headless-chromium-sandbox` skill recipe rebuilt everything in ~3 min;
  don't assume `/tmp` state survives between sessions.

## Rating history (visual review, "map-like vs bar-chart/rectangular", 1-10)

| Version | Score | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| v5 (initial curved coastline) | ~4/10 | Eastern regions still read as full-height vertical bars |
| v6 (in-region coastline wander) | 5.5/10 | Internal wobble added, still columnar |
| v7 (artistic-license asymmetry) | 6-7.2/10 | Transformer/Generative border wanders, heights differ |
| v8 (global funnel envelope) | 6.5/10 | Overall width now varies 4.7x (88px→415px) west-to-east — real structural fix. Alan's verdict after seeing v8: **"still too 90 degree rectangular... basic allocations still too rigidly along x and y grids"** |
| v9 (shipped `e2bf8c3`) | 8.5/10 (independent) | Diagonal isochrone frontiers: each region's arrival/departure year differs BY BAND. Alan: "looking pretty good" + two asks → v10. |
| v10 (shipped `c2fb8c0`) | see run report | Alan's two v9 asks: (1) present-day coast now spans N1a–S2b in every column from 2024.3 (the v7 receding-N1a / ragged N2a–S2a GRID rows were the cause, not the registry or ENV); (2) BIOME tints ~2× saturation, wash .13→.30, border band .26→.48. |

## Key structural insight (v8 → v9 turning point)

The root cause of "rectangular" feel was diagnosed precisely by Alan: every
region boundary was `x = start_year`, a single x-value for the whole
boundary regardless of band (N1..S2). Wobble/noise on top of that is still
fundamentally a vertical line. The v9 fix: boundaries become
`x = f(band, year)` — genuine diagonal frontiers, e.g. a paradigm can reach
the language band years before it reaches the embodiment/control band.
Full brief is in `/tmp/fable_prompt12.txt` (not in this repo — recreate from
this log if needed, or read the git history/STATUS.md for what actually
shipped).

## Working pattern established (keep using this)

1. Single Fable job at a time against `/home/node/map-of-ai` — never run two
   concurrently, avoid git races.
2. Each dispatch: write full spec/brief to `/tmp/fable_promptN.txt`, wrapper
   script `/tmp/run_mapofaiN.sh` (git pull → export GITHUB_TOKEN/GH_TOKEN
   from `/home/node/agent/.env` → `hermes -z "$(cat prompt)" -m
   vertex-claude-fable-5-1 --yolo`, output tee'd to `/tmp/fable_runN.log`).
   Run via `terminal(background=true, notify_on_complete=true)`.
3. On completion: pull, check `git log`, read the tail of the run log for
   Fable's self-report, then **independently verify** — curl the live URL
   for `last-modified` freshness, screenshot with the Playwright script
   pattern (see any `/tmp/shot_v*.py` for the working recipe — needs
   `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/tmp/pw-browsers`,
   `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/localroot/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu:/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`,
   `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uvcache`, run via `uv run --with playwright`), then
   `vision_analyze` on the screenshot with a non-leading prompt. Don't just
   trust Fable's self-reported rating — cross-check independently every time.
4. ADLC/spec-kit artifacts already exist in-repo: `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`,
   `STATUS.md` (source of truth for state), `scripts/validate.py` (V-01..V-60
   rules), decision records in `AXES.md`/`ALTITUDES.md`. Fable is instructed
   to keep `STATUS.md` current every pass — check there first for the fullest
   picture of registry/data state.
5. Alan granted "artistic license" for this creative/visual work — prioritize
   directional correctness over literal data precision.
6. Model in use for texture generation: `gemini-3-pro-image` (global endpoint
   only — regional 404s). No Gemini 2.x anywhere in the repo (verified).
7. Farm Table (`ft` CLI) is NOT installed in this sandbox. Alan flagged it as
   optional ("if you need more try farmtable"). Not needed yet — this is a
   single-track sequential pipeline, not parallel multi-agent work. Revisit
   if/when work fans out to genuinely parallel independent tracks (e.g.
   countries/cities layer built concurrently with geometry polish).

## v9 job anomaly (2026-09-08, pre-compaction) — ROOT CAUSE FOUND

Two consecutive job attempts (`proc_eedaa61d915b`, `proc_6c2011773086`) each
ran 20-25 min, exited 0, produced zero commits. Root cause found by reading
the session transcript directly (`session_search` on session id
`20260908_041306_77f71c`): Fable called `vision_analyze` on its own
screenshot and then tried to **transcribe the full analysis verbatim** in
its response, hit the output-length truncation limit, got a "continue where
you left off" system nudge, tried again, got truncated again — burning the
entire turn/time budget on narrating a screenshot description instead of
writing code. It never got past reading the geometry file before the
session ended (`agent_close`). Not a git/infra/hermes-CLI problem — a
prompting problem. **Fix for future prompts to Fable:** explicitly instruct
it to summarize `vision_analyze` output in 2-3 sentences (facts needed for
the decision only), never transcribe/quote it at length, and to prioritize
writing code over narrating analysis. HEAD is still `25c295e` (v8) as of
this checkpoint — v9 (diagonal isochrone frontiers) has NOT shipped yet.

## Next steps after v9 lands

1. Verify v9 independently (see pattern above).
2. If diagonal frontiers genuinely break the grid-aligned perception, ask
   Alan whether to proceed to the countries/cities data layer (Phase 3/4 per
   PROJECT_PLAN.md) or keep polishing continent-level geometry.
3. If v9 still reads rigid, the next lever (per Fable's v8 report) is
   possibly allowing the Deep Learning Basin to reach N2 (currently
   registry-capped at C-S2), which needs an ALTITUDES/REGISTRY decision from
   Alan, not just a render tweak.
